# LilyPad
LilyPad is an open-source platform that helps educators train, test, and ship AI assistants. 
## What are AI Assistants?
AI assistants are trained on your educational data (e.g., lectures, slides, handouts) and help you understand and do stuff. For instance, AI assistants can be configured to answer questions about specific courses (e.g., what are Newton's 3 Laws of Physics?), or answer higher-level questions about your department (e.g., who taught Calculus 3 last semester?). They can make slides or homework based on past examples, or they can be personal tutors for every student.
## How does LilyPad Help?
Configuring, training, and testing AI Assistants can be complicated. LilyPad provides educators with an intuitive set of tools that simplifies the process of building and maintaining your own AI systems. With little to no training, educators can deliver grounded and relevant AI experiences to their students.
